    <h1>International Mobility</h1>
    <p>During my studies, I aim to develop my international experience through exchange programs and professional projects abroad.</p>

    <h2>Northern Europe</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Nordic countries</strong>Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are known for their innovation, 
      sustainability, and strong engineering culture.  
      I am particularly interested in these regions for their expertise in renewable energies, 
      data-driven industries, and high-quality education systems.  
      Their emphasis on balance, equality, and technology aligns perfectly with my values and professional goals.
    </p>

    <h3>South America</h3>
    <p>
      I also have a strong interest in <strong>South America</strong>, having already discovered the cultural richness 
      of Peru. Exploring countries such as <strong>Chile</strong> and <strong>Argentina</strong> would be a great opportunity 
      to understand different approaches to engineering and sustainability challenges, while improving my Spanish.
